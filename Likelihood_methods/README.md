About Likelihood methods

    + Great deal in Likelihood methods.  

    + More rigorous, it hides some crucial details which can lead to misunderstandings (compared to Lehmann's books). So dangerous...

    + Presents likelihood methods with examples. 

    + Less rigorous than Severini's book.

You may notice that the above references may treat concepts in different manner (e.g., use different assumptions to derive the same results. eg asymptotic distribution of MLE. This is reasonable.)
